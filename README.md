## Abstract
Parkinson's disease-mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) within the context of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). PD-MCI is associated with an elevated risk of further cognitive decline and progression to Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD). As PDD typically involves more substantial cognitive deficits and functional impairment that necessitate assisted living, research in PD-MCI has garnered much academic and industry interest. However, existing methods of PD-MCI diagnosis often rely on manual scoring, idiosyncratic algorithms, or complicated software; these approaches can be time-intensive, error-prone, or inaccessible due to high costs and limited customizability. 

Currently, no publicly-available tool exists to automate the diagnosis of PD-MCI based on objective cognitive, subjective cognitive, and functional impairment utilizing neuropsychological data. Therefore, we created PD-MCIx, an open-source diagnostic tool available for download in R and Python, and available via the Hugging Face platform (https://github.com/conxie/PD-MCIx). The tool employs rule-based logic derived from the 2012 Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria for PD-MCI diagnosis and was validated with two independent datasets: Dataset_1 (n = 99) and Dataset_2 (n = 181). 
Both datasets contained baseline scores (i.e., neuropsychological assessments and self-report surveys) where the parent studies evaluated neuropsychological functioning in those with PD. Datasets contained licensed neuropsychologist (clinician)-reviewed diagnoses which were used as a benchmark to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of PD-MCIx. Two-part validation was done using Cohen’s Kappa and a proportion test. There was substantial agreement between the algorithm and the clinical diagnosis, κ = .64, 95% CI [0.49, 0.78] (Dataset_1) and κ = .70, 95% CI [0.57, 0.83] (Dataset_2), indicating that the automated classification aligned well with clinician reviewed diagnoses. The proportion tests revealed 81.9% (Dataset_1) and 91.6% (Dataset_2) accuracy with clinician-reviewed diagnosis based on participant data. Results indicate that PD-MCIx is comparable to clinician reviewed diagnoses, and thus, PD-MCIx is a valid tool that researchers can use to assist in the identification of PD-MCI.
