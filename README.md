# PD-MCIx

## Abstract
When Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) occurs in the context of Parkinson’s Disease (PD-MCI), individuals face an elevated risk of further cognitive decline and eventual progression to Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PD-D). Existing methods of PD-MCI diagnosis often rely on manual scoring, idiosyncratic algorithms, or complicated software; these approaches can be time-intensive, error-prone, or inaccessible due to high costs and limited customizability. Currently, no publically-available tool exists to automate the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments (MCI) in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) based on objective cognitive, subjective cognitive, and functional impairment utilizing neuropsychological data. Therefore, we created PD-MCIx, an open-source diagnostic tool available for download in R and Python, and available via the Hugging Face platform, which employs rule-based logic derived from the 2012 MDS Task Force criteria. PD-MCIx was validated on 2 datasets: (1) DoD (n = 99) and (2) LONG (n = 181); both contained baseline scores where the parent study evaluated those with Parkinson’s Disease. Datasets contained clinician-reviewed diagnosis based on participant data which was used as a benchmark to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of PD-MCIx. McNemar's chi-square test with continuity correction indicated a significant difference between the paired proportions, χ²(1, n = 99) = 12.19, p < .002, while the proportion test indicates 81.9% accuracy with clinician-reviewed diagnosis for DoD. For LONG, McNemar's test and proportion test reveals p < .01, and 89.6% accuracy with clinician-reviewed diagnosis based on participant data. Specifically, McNemar's chi-square test with continuity correction indicated a significant difference between the paired proportions, χ²(1, n = 181) = 10.5, p < .01. PD-MCIx is a curated algorithm researchers can use in lieu of writing their own scripts that produces a classification detailing the presence of MCI, amnestic versus non-Amnestic subtype, and single versus multiple domain subtype.
